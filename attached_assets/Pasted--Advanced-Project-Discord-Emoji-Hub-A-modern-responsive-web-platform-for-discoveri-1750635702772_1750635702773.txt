A modern, responsive web platform for discovering and downloading Discord emojis with real-time stats, full API, SDKs, advanced upload/viewing features, and AI-powered moderation.

---

### 🎯 **Site Structure**

**Theme:** Blue + black (dark-mode first), fully responsive
**Navbar:** Animated logo **+** site name

---

### 🏠 1. Landing Page

* Hero section with site title, description, call-to-action
* **Live stats** (total emojis, downloads, likes, last upload) via **WebSocket/SSE**
* Prominent **“Upload Emoji”** CTA button

> **Everything below the live-stats block is removed.**
>
> * No “Featured Emojis” carousel
> * No “Platform Features” strip
> * No “Developer API” teaser
>   (These still exist on their own dedicated pages.)
>   Fake “+X today” pills inside the stats are also removed.

---

### ☁️ 2. Upload Page

* Drag-and-drop **or** file picker (PNG, GIF, APNG ≤ 256 KB, ≤ **250 × 250 px**)
* Text inputs & search fields use dark styling (black bg, light text) so they’re visible
* Upload button styled, visible, and disabled until a valid file is chosen
* Auto-increment emoji ID (six-digit, zero-padded)
* Store file at `storage/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<ID>.<ext>`
* Append metadata entry to `storage/metadata.json`
* Emit real-time stat updates to connected clients

#### Error handling fixes

* Return 400 only if **no file present**; display clear toast (“Please choose a file first”).
* Vite socket fix—inject correct port so URL becomes `wss://localhost:<PORT>/...`.

### 🖼️ 3. Emoji Viewer Page

* Multi-select → bulk ZIP download; single click → direct download (+1 download)
* Like button with per-IP / per-Discord-user throttling
* **Pretty animations** for hover, load-in, and like-pulse

### 🛡️ 7. Advanced Moderation & Safety

* **Custom AI image-classifier** trained in-house (no third-party SaaS):

  * Tiny-ViT backbone + NSFW head, TFLite model loaded in worker thread
  * Rejects explicit, gore, hateful imagery with ≥ 95 % confidence
* Bad-word / slur filter on emoji names & tags (fast DFA matcher)
* Hash-dedup & known-bad database (SHA-256)
* Virus / malicious-payload scan for animated formats
* Manual review queue (admin dashboard) for borderline cases
* Moderation logs to `logs/moderation.log` + `/api/moderation` feed

---

### ⚙️ Backend & Storage Details

* Flat `metadata.json` with in-memory LRU cache; flush every 30 s
* Strict date-based folder hierarchy
* Middleware: rate-limit (5 uploads / min / IP), CORS, security headers, moderation pipeline
* Graceful 404 + generic error page
* **ID routing:** visiting `/emoji/000123` serves detailed page for that emoji

---

### 🤖 Optional Discord Slash-Command Bot *(disabled by default)*

* `/delete`, `/like`, `/purge`, `/import` — toggled by `.env`
* Bot card and references **removed from homepage**

---

### 🚀 Dev & Deployment

* `.replit` launches web server **(+ optional bot)** with hot reload
* Animated loading skeletons, page-enter transitions, parallax hero, etc.
* Works perfectly centered on ultra-wide and mobile via CSS grid / flex
* `README.md` includes setup, env vars, SDK usage, AI-moderation write-up

  * Automated unit + integration tests (including moderation)
